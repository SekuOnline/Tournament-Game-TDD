# Intro
This repository contains a submission for a Software QA class at Carleton University. The rules for the game and instructions for programming must remain undisclosed as per the Carleton University's standards.
This assignment demonstrates applied knowledge of TDD fundamentals of Software QA.

# Methodology
This project demonstrates successful application of Test Driven Development (TDD) principles. The requirements for the game were first derived from use-cases, and broken down into basic functions. 
These functions were then incrementally incremented through Test-Code pairs, labeled as "CODE X:" and "U-TEST X:" within commits.
Occasionally, refactors labeled "REFAC X: were used to adjust names, documentation, and basic functionality of previous commits. 
Finally, acceptance suites were added to test combinations of test cases within a real-time environment.

# Instructions to run code: 
### Requirements: 
Intellij IDEA

1. Download and unzip the repository's files, manually or using Git.
2. Within IntelliJ, open the repository. When prompted, choose to load Maven.
3. The game itself can be run by executing GameMain.java, found at src/main/java/org/example/GameMain.java
    The Unit-Test Suite can be run by executing GameMainUnitTest.java at src/test/java/org/example/GameMainUnitTest.java
